# there is nothing like the normal pairs that we have in cpp
# in python we can use tuples to achieve the same functionality


# tuples are immutable, so we cannot change the values of a tuple after it is created.
# However, we can create a new tuple with the desired values.


# Example of list of pairs or tuples
pairs = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
print(pairs)
