Ever stared at a problem and thought: "Where do I even start?"
Here’s the truth: Great problem solvers don’t always know the answer — they know how to explore.

Here’s a compilation of 28 tactical ideas you can try when you're stuck on an unseen problem with no clue for progress:

🧩 Structural Tweaks

1️⃣ Fix a parameter (e.g., assume n = 1, x = 0)
2️⃣ Reverse the process / solve backwards
3️⃣ Solve on paper for small inputs
4️⃣ Sort elements (inputs, ranges, queries)
5️⃣ Change the order of operations
6️⃣ Break into smaller subproblems

🧠 Model the Problem Differently

7️⃣ Think in terms of states and transitions (DP)
8️⃣ Turn it into a graph problem
9️⃣ Convert to math or algebraic form
🔟 Consider geometry or coordinate transformations

🔍 Analytical Thinking

1️⃣1️⃣ Try brute force first and look for patterns
1️⃣2️⃣ Think about the information being preserved across operations
1️⃣3️⃣ What’s impossible in this problem? Use it
1️⃣4️⃣ Use the extremal principle: try pushing values to max/min
1️⃣5️⃣ Try proving impossibility rather than finding construction
1️⃣6️⃣ Consider what changes and what remains invariant
1️⃣7️⃣ Think about constraints: Can you ignore some?

🧪 Experimental / Simulative

1️⃣8️⃣ Randomize inputs and simulate
1️⃣9️⃣ Try hashing / set tricks
2️⃣0️⃣ Write a brute + optimized version to compare answers
2️⃣1️⃣ Do a pen-and-paper dry run

🔁 Transform the Problem

2️⃣2️⃣ Flip the objective: minimize → maximize, construct → prove
2️⃣3️⃣ Turn the problem into a game or process
2️⃣4️⃣ Apply binary search on the answer
2️⃣5️⃣ Consider prefix/suffix structures
2️⃣6️⃣ Try greedy — always
2️⃣7️⃣ Think recursively, or try divide-and-conquer

🚀 General Principles

2️⃣8️⃣ Keep moving: Even partial ideas are progress. Explore, then optimize.

💡 Final Takeaway:

Being good at problem solving doesn’t mean knowing more. It means being systematic in exploration.
